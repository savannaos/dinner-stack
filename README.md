# dinner-stack
Run GUI.py for GUI

essential methods are in dinnerstack.py


Can't make dinner for me but can't remove the hassle of deciding what's for dinner. Cycles through a list of dinners making it easier to prepare and allowing me to use my mental effort elsewhere. Can also push new ideas and peak at what dinner is next up. Popping a dinner moves it to the end of the list. Simple GUI added.
